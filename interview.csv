1,60,"Mr. Armstrong asked me to reschedule his dinner plans on the evening of June 15th. He mentioned needing to review merger documents with Sarah before tomorrow's announcement. He seemed tense but not unusually so. I left his office around 6:30 PM, and he was on a video call with someone - I think it was Thomas Wright from Evergreen Capital.",20230616,1045,422,0.95
2,40,"I was supposed to meet Elijah at 8:30 PM to go over the final merger numbers, but he texted me at 7:50 saying he needed another hour. When I arrived around 9:45 PM, security couldn't reach him, and his office door was locked from the inside. I never saw him that evening.",20230616,1130,420,0.92
3,30,"Yes, Elijah and I had a disagreement about security protocols earlier that week. It was strictly professional. On the night in question, I was working in the R&D lab until about 9 PM, then went straight home. Check the badge logs if you don't believe me. This merger was going to make us all rich - why would I jeopardize that?",20230616,1415,420,0.75
4,50,"I was conducting a security sweep of floors 45 through 48 when Mr. Armstrong was presumably killed. The system shows my badge accessing those floors between 8:15 PM and 9:30 PM. It's my job to check all areas. I noticed the security camera on the 50th floor was malfunctioning, but that wasn't unusual given the upgrades we were implementing.",20230616,1620,422,0.88
5,20,I was at dinner with potential investors from QuantumLink. We were discussing partnership opportunities. We were at The Grand Hotel from 7 PM until nearly midnight. Multiple witnesses and receipts can confirm this. I heard about Elijah's death when the police called me.,20230616,1815,420,0.91
6,70,"As a board member, I had concerns about the merger. Elijah was moving too fast, not performing proper due diligence. We argued about it on Tuesday, but ultimately, it was his company. I was in Beijing on the 15th, giving a keynote at a technology conference. My travel records and livestream of my speech will confirm this.",20230617,930,422,0.97
7,80,"I started at CryptoSphere just over a month ago, after the security breach at the R&D lab. Marcus hired me specifically to overhaul the biometric systems. I was updating server configurations remotely from my apartment on the night Mr. Armstrong died. The system logs will show my access credentials.",20230617,1100,425,0.85
8,90,"I had no interaction with Mr. Armstrong on the day he died. I was coding in my office until about 8 PM, then went to JavaBeans Coffee Shop to meet some friends. I didn't even know about the murder until the next morning when we were all called in.",20230617,1345,425,0.93
9,100,"I had a video call with Elijah at around 7:30 PM to discuss some last-minute terms for the merger financing. He seemed fine, perhaps a bit preoccupied. The call ended at 7:45 PM. I was at my club the rest of the evening - the Downtown Executive Club has me on their security cameras.",20230617,1630,422,0.9
10,110,"I was working late on the quantum encryption breakthrough. The diplomatic implications of the vulnerability I found in Project Phoenix were staggering. I tried to warn Elijah back in June, but he wouldn't listen. Now look what's happened. Someone accessed my research using diplomatic override codes - the same type used in the Armstrong case.",20231004,1015,430,0.96
11,130,Dr. Zhang was acting strange in the weeks before her death. She mentioned something about a connection between the Armstrong murder and international quantum computing standards. Said she had proof of unauthorized diplomatic access to our systems.,20231004,1145,430,0.89
12,140,"Our security logs showed multiple breaches using quantum-based attack vectors. The pattern matched the CryptoSphere incident, but with diplomatic-grade modifications. Dr. Zhang was about to present evidence to the International Quantum Computing Board.",20231004,1330,430,0.92
13,150,I detected unauthorized access to the quantum lab using Dr. Zhang's credentials simultaneously from three locations. One traced back to the Geneva diplomatic complex. The others matched IPs from the Armstrong case.,20231004,1515,430,0.87
14,160,Last communication with Dr. Zhang concerned critical vulnerabilities in quantum encryption standards. She mentioned evidence linking the Armstrong murder to international quantum computing espionage. Then she discovered something in the diplomatic protocols...,20230808,1045,450,0.95
15,170,My security team detected quantum-based intrusions matching patterns from both the Armstrong and Zhang cases. The diplomatic override codes used were supposed to be classified. Someone with high-level access is involved.,20230808,1230,450,0.93
16,180,The security breach in Geneva used the same quantum encryption signature as the Zhang murder. Both connected to Armstrong's Project Phoenix through diplomatic channels. This goes deeper than we thought.,20230808,1415,450,0.91
17,190,"Intelligence analysis shows a clear pattern: Armstrong's murder, the Geneva incident, and Zhang's death are connected through quantum encryption protocols. Someone's trying to prevent the exposure of a critical vulnerability.",20230808,1600,450,0.94
18,60,"The day before Mr. Armstrong died, I overheard Viktor on a call in the stairwell. He was speaking Russian and mentioned 'Orlova' 'tomorrow evening,' 'package,' and 'Armstrong' multiple times. I speak some Russian from my college studies. I didn't think much of it until after the murder.He also said something about BMW X5",20230617,1730,422,0.97
